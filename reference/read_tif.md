# Read an image stored in the TIFF format

Reads an image from a TIFF file/content into a numeric array or list.

## Usage

``` r
read_tif(
  path,
  frames = "all",
  list_safety = "error",
  msg = TRUE,
  convert = "auto"
)

tif_read(
  path,
  frames = "all",
  list_safety = "error",
  msg = TRUE,
  convert = "auto"
)
```

## Arguments

- path:

  A string, the path to the tiff file to read. `path` may also be a raw
  vector of TIFF bytes, read in-memory.

- frames:

  Which frames do you want to read. Default all. To read the 2nd and 7th
  frames, use `frames = c(2, 7)`.

- list_safety:

  A string. This is for type safety of this function. Since returning a
  list is unlikely and probably unexpected, the default is to error. You
  can instead opt to throw a warning (`list_safety = "warning"`) or to
  just return the list quietly (`list_safety = "none"`).

- msg:

  Print an informative message about the image being read?

- convert:

  One of `"auto"` (default), `"force"`, `"never"`, controlling libtiff's
  RGBA decoder. `"auto"` reads every image directly and only falls back
  to RGBA for images the direct decoder cannot parse at all (certain
  tiled/planar or odd-bit-depth files that would otherwise error),
  preserving existing behaviour for all currently-readable images.
  `"force"` always decodes via RGBA, converting any colorspace (YCbCr,
  CMYK, CIELab, ...) to 8-bit RGB(A) — use this to read such images in
  RGB. `"never"` never uses the RGBA decoder and errors on images the
  direct decoder cannot parse. Note: for images with frames of differing
  dimensions read as a list, the converted arrays keep their raw
  per-frame dimensions and are not reconciled.

## Value

An object of class
[ijtiff_img](https://docs.ropensci.org/ijtiff/reference/ijtiff_img.md)
or a list of
[ijtiff_img](https://docs.ropensci.org/ijtiff/reference/ijtiff_img.md)s.

## Details

TIFF files have the capability to store multiple images, each having
multiple channels. Typically, these multiple images represent the
sequential frames in a time-stack or z-stack of images and hence each of
these images has the same dimension. If this is the case, they are all
read into a single 4-dimensional array `img` where `img` is indexed as
`img[y, x, channel, frame]` (where we have `y, x` to comply with the
conventional `row, col` indexing of a matrix - it means that images
displayed as arrays of numbers in the R console will have the correct
orientation). However, it is possible that the images in the TIFF file
have varying dimensions (most people have never seen this), in which
case they are read in as a list of images, where again each element of
the list is a 4-dimensional array `img`, indexed as
`img[y, x, channel, frame]`.

A (somewhat random) set of TIFF tags are attributed to the read image.
These are ImageDepth, BitsPerSample, SamplesPerPixel, SampleFormat,
PlanarConfig, Compression, Threshholding, XResolution, YResolution,
ResolutionUnit, Indexed and Orientation. More tags should be added in a
subsequent version of this package. You can read about TIFF tags at
https://www.awaresystems.be/imaging/tiff/tifftags.html.

TIFF images can have a wide range of internal representations, but only
the most common in image processing are supported (8-bit, 16-bit and
32-bit integer and 32-bit float samples, and 12-bit grayscale integer
samples).

## Note

- 12-bit grayscale TIFFs are supported (values returned in 0..4095,
  assuming big-endian packing); 12-bit colour, colormap, and tiled
  12-bit TIFFs are not.

- There is no standard for packing order for TIFFs beyond 8-bit so we
  assume big-endian packing.

- RGBA conversion (`convert = "auto"`/`"force"`) is unavailable for
  tiled separate-planar images, which therefore cannot be read at all

## Author

Simon Urbanek wrote most of this code for the 'tiff' package. Rory Nolan
lifted it from there and changed it around a bit for this 'ijtiff'
package. Credit should be directed towards Lord Urbanek.

## Examples

``` r
img <- read_tif(system.file("img", "Rlogo.tif", package = "ijtiff"))
#> Reading image from /github/home/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.6/ijtiff/img/Rlogo.tif
#> Reading an 8-bit, integer image with dimensions 76x100x4x1 (y,x,channel,frame) . . .
```
